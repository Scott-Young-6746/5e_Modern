After Clans and Kingdoms
    In a modern campaign consider how dwarven culture might have progressed.
    The PHB suggests that dwarves are motivated by gold, precious metals, and clan honour.
    Would the lesser clans have ousted their autocratic government?
    Would they have established a plutocracy based on trade with the outside world?
    Would they have formed a federation of clans? Is there one clan which controls the others as vassals?
    Or has the dwarven respect for tradition kept them on the same politcal course for centuries?

    These are the questions you must answer as an aspiring 5e Modern GM. The answers to these questions
    impact the world will build, and the stories your players can craft for their characters.

Gods, Gold and Clan
    The motivations of adventuring are highly dependant on the world you build.

    In a low civilization campaign, adventuring could be a lucrative job for a 
    dwarf hungry for money, searching for a lost heirloom or looking to acquire fame.

    In a high civilization campaign, a dwarven adventure could be a mercinary, a
    devout follower of a deity striving to uphold the values of their god or a
    buding warlord looking to stake a claim in another plane of the realms.
