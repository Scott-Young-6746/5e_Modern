Bards in the new world:
    The bards of old were educated, cultured weavers of tales and song.
    Charsimatic and skilled, these heros were a boon to their parties.
    Between adventures, they could recount tales and entertain locals.
    Their aptitude for the arcane was not to be ignored either, and
    their spells could make or break a hard fight.

    The Bards of today are not much different in abstract, but the tools
    of their trade have changed. Lutes and horns have been traded for 
    guitars and launchpads. The bard of today is a technologist as much
    as he is a mage.
